Virus-Propagation
=================

Simulation of virus propagation and immunization in Static and time varying networks.

A fundamental problem in epidemiology is determining whether a virus will result in an epidemic (that is, if it will 
rapidly spread to many people) or if it will die quickly. Recent works on virus propagation have approached this problem from a network perspective. Given a network of individuals, where the edges represent who can potentially infect whom, the rate of propagation of a virus across the network will depend on the connectivity of the network and on the propagation model of the virus. More precisely, researchers have determined that the strength of the virus can be defined as a function of the largest eigenvalue of the networkâ€™s adjacency matrix. These results have important implications for the design and evaluation of immunization policies, and can be applied to many problems, such as minimizing the spread of malware in computer networks or maximizing the spread of a marketing campaign across a social network.

Goals of the Project: Analyze the propagation of a virus in a network and prevent a network-wide epidemic

Analyze and understand a virus propagation model.
2. Calculate the effective strength of a virus.
3. Simulate the propagation of a virus in a network.
4. Implement immunization policies to prevent a virus from spreading across a network.
